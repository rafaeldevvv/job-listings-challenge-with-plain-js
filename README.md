## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wanted to try to make the same application with plain js. It was fun. Most part of this code is based on the code of the last project of the book [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke. This is a really good book.

I saw people using this binding to select elements in the document and I wanted to try it too. chatGPT just taught me that I had to bind the querySelector method to the document object or call it with the document object.

```js
const $ = (query) => document.querySelector(query);
```
